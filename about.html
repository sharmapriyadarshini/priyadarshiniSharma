              Hello, my name is Priyadarshini Sharma. 
              <br>
              <br>
                I come from the serene town of Shimla, India. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology and Management at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
                My expected graduation is in December 2024 
              <br>  
                I started my master of science in Spring 2023. During my time at the University of Texas at Dallas, I embarked on a journey of learning and growth, immersing myself in a diverse array of coursework 
                that encompassed Marketing Management, Database Foundations for Business Analytics, and Intelligent Enterprise Systems with SAP during the spring semester.

                Currently, I am engaged as a Marketing Officer at the Project Management Club at the University of Texas at Dallas, since March 2023. I have had the privilege of working closely with a dedicated marketing team and fellow club members 
                to craft impactful marketing materials and campaigns. Our collective efforts have resulted in a remarkable 20% increase in event attendance and a notable upsurge in membership sign-ups, demonstrating our ability to engage and connect with our target audience effectively.
                
                One of the most fulfilling aspects of my role has been the opportunity to coordinate and oversee a series of successful events, ranging from workshops and seminars to networking sessions. Through close collaboration with both club members and external partners, 
                we have orchestrated events that have garnered a resounding 95% positive feedback rate from attendees. This achievement underscores our commitment to delivering valuable and memorable experiences to our community.
              <br>
                Currently, I am in my second semester at UT Dallas, where I am actively immersing myself in a range of courses such as Business Data Warehousing, Statistics of Data Analysis, Operations Management, 
                and System Analysis and Project Management. My pursuit of knowledge is unwavering, and I am committed to furthering my academic journey.

                As I continue to grow and develop, both personally and professionally, I am actively seeking internship opportunities that will enable me to apply and expand upon the skills and knowledge I am acquiring. 
                The prospect of gaining hands-on experience in my field excites me, and I eagerly anticipate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead on my path of growth and discovery.
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering and a three-year diploma in Computer Engineering. I was exposed to a plethora of courses such as Database Systems, 
                Data Structures, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Theory of Computations, Data Communication and Networks, Computer Networks and security, Data Mining and analysis, Business Intelligence, 
                Computer Assembly and maintenance, Programming Through C, JAVA, VB.Net language, Software Engineering, Computer Graphics, etc. To develop a more pragmatic approach to computer science, I also gained knowledge about MSDOS, 
                WINDOWS, LINUX, and UNIX, and became familiar with programming languages like C, C++, JAVA, HTML, PHP, Python, SQL, and packages like VB.net and ORACLE.
              <br>
                In the last year of my undergraduate degree, I had the privilege of working as a Data Analyst Intern at “PLUS Assets Research & Management”. My job responsibilities here included gathering 
                requirements from our customers, finding patterns in a complex and large set of data, and planning, developing, implementing & analyzing the market trends. I also worked on SQL, Microsoft Excel, 
                and Microsoft Power BI to create pivot tables, charts, and reports. I also utilized this time to improve my technical skills and I started learning to work on analytics tools like Tableau, D3, 
                Xplenty, Vertica, and Hadoop. My efforts finally paid off when I was offered a full-time role as a business analyst at the same company, which I continue to do. In the early part of my job as a 
                Business Analyst, I used to study and analyze the market, Research business problems, draft the non-functional requirements, and create the main backlog, and data pipelines to improve analysis. 
                My responsibilities were to provide analytical insights and consult with our clients so that they could make better decisions and evaluate these processes for efficiency, cost, and results.
                Throughout my tenure, I demonstrated expertise in understanding business strategies, goals, and requirements to create financial models supporting sound business decisions. My analytical journey didn't stop there; 
                I also delved into the world of data analysis. I worked extensively with large datasets, using data visualization to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. This allowed me to enhance our data-driven outcomes significantly.
                Furthermore, I honed my forecasting, budgeting, variance analysis, and financial analysis skills. This multifaceted role allowed me to sharpen my analytical skills and gain invaluable experience in handling substantial datasets. 
                Witnessing how data can shape and illuminate insights has always captivated me. This realization propelled me toward the decision to pursue a Master's degree in Information Technology and Management. 
              <br>
                During my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, each offering unique challenges and learning experiences.
                
                One of my notable endeavors involved delving into the realm of data exploration with SQL. I undertook a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data, dissecting information from two distinct tables, Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations. This journey led me to analyze global COVID-19 cases, 
                population statistics, mortality rates, and vaccination data. I applied various SQL techniques, including aggregate functions and filtering conditions, to uncover insights. The project allowed me to grasp the scope of the dataset and discern emerging trends, reinforcing my understanding of data analysis.<br>

                Additionally, I collaborated with a team to craft a marketing plan for a Car Lift Service for the course Marketing Management. Our collective efforts encompassed a wide range of tasks, from conducting SWOT analyses to implementing strategic initiatives and projecting financial outcomes. 
                We meticulously evaluated our strategies and established stringent control measures to ensure the plan's success.
                <br>
                During my under graduation, I ventured into the domain of artificial intelligence by creating a Sign Language Interpreter using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This endeavor aimed to empower the deaf community in their daily communication needs. I curated a vast dataset 
                comprising grayscale images of American Sign Language gestures, employing Python's OpenCV library. By leveraging this dataset, I developed a model capable of interpreting sign language gestures, demonstrating the profound impact technology can have on enhancing accessibility. 
                I engineered a Room Classifier using Python, which utilized logistic regression and transfer learning methodologies. This project's goal was to automate the identification of tidy and cluttered spaces. By adapting a pre-trained object classification model for scene classification, 
                I achieved a robust classifier, enabling the automated differentiation between tidy and untidy rooms. I embarked on the development of an e-ATM machine using Python, integrating it with a Wamp Server and MySQL database to facilitate financial activities such as cash withdrawals, deposits, and fund transfers for customers. These projects represent my journey in the world of technology and data analysis, 
                showcasing my passion for problem-solving and innovation.
              <br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                 While I may not be a programming wizard, I do possess a genuine passion for technology and its impact on our lives. My academic journey has led me through various courses, and I've gained exposure to different programming languages, such as 
                C, C++, JAVA, and Python. My curiosity, academics, and work have also driven me to explore tools like Microsoft Office, and SQL. I've also explored the world of data visualization using tools like Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.<be>
              <br>
                Beyond academics and work, I believe in giving back and making a positive impact on my community. For a year, I dedicated myself to tutoring, and assisting children aged 8-12 in 
                subjects like math, science, and English. The heartfelt feedback I received from both students and parents underscored the importance of effective communication and engaging teaching. 
                <br>

                Leadership also finds its place in my journey. As the Head of the Committee for Punjab University's Fest, with my team, I orchestrated successful college festivals, APRATIM and GUNJ. 
                Bringing people together, meticulous planning, and seeing everything come to life filled me with a deep sense of satisfaction.
                <br>
                I find joy in the simple things. I'm a coin collector and  a good cook, and I love writing and reading. Gardening soothes my soul, and hiking gets my adrenaline pumping.

                In essence, I'm a firm believer in holistic growth. I embrace challenges, I'm not afraid to dive into new domains, and I'm dedicated to becoming the best version of myself. My journey is a blend of 
                technology, education, community, leadership, and personal passions. And I can't wait to see where it takes me next.
